A clean, modern, and lightweight iOS Wordle clone built with Swift and UIKit. It supports 5-letter word guesses with intuitive keyboard input, color-coded feedback, and a responsive game board.

This project demonstrates:

Implementation of a dynamic game board using UICollectionView.

Real-time feedback with color-coded boxes for correct, partially correct, and incorrect letters.

Modular MVC architecture with a clear separation of view, controller, and data logic.
